- Provide basic form validations (mandatory/email, etc)
- After successful login, navigate to a basic dashboard page (can be a blank page with user name displayed)
- Follow the monday.com design system
- Mock the login and sign up APIs
- Implement successful signup and login scenarios using mock
- Implement failure login scenario using mock
- Write unit and integration (e2e using mocks) tests -- in progress
- Push the code to your github account and share us the link

## Technology Stack

- Use latest stable versions of React and Next.js
- Use Typescript
- Use any design libraries (MUI/Tailwind CSS/Fluent Design System/Ant Design, etc)
- Use Redux Toolkit for state management
- Use any mock implementations (local or cloud based)

## Design System

- Create the components that are necessary for the login and signup pages (No need to implement all the components as in the design system)
- Implement design system using Storybook as a separate reusable library
- Create Storybook tests for component testing -- in progress
- Integrate design system into main project using any mono repo tools

## Testing

Create unit tests for components, screens, state, API codes
